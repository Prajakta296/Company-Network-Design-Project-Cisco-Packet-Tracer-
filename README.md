Company-Network-Design-Project-Cisco-Packet-Tracer-

📘 Overview
This project is a complete enterprise network design and configuration built using **Cisco Packet Tracer** as part of my CCNA practical training.  
It demonstrates end-to-end configuration of LAN, inter-VLAN routing, DHCP, OSPF, ACL, PAT, SSH access, and network verification.

🧩 Network Topology
The topology includes:
- Routers
- Layer 3 Switches (Multilayer)
- Layer 2 Switches
- DHCP Server
- Wireless Access Point
- End devices (PCs, Laptops, Printers, etc.)

⚙️ Configuration Steps

1. **Basic Setup**
   - Hostname, password encryption, banner, SSH configuration on routers and switches  
2. **VLAN Configuration**
   - VLAN creation and port assignment (Access & Trunk ports)
3. **Switchport Security**
   - Configured port security for the Finance department
4. **IP Addressing & Subnetting**
   - Applied logical IP addressing to all interfaces
5. **Dynamic Routing (OSPF)**
   - Configured OSPF on routers and L3 switches
6. **Static IP & DHCP**
   - Assigned static IPs to servers  
   - Configured DHCP for dynamic IP allocation
7. **Inter-VLAN Routing**
   - Implemented routing between VLANs with helper addresses
8. **Wireless Configuration**
   - Configured wireless connectivity for end users
9. **PAT & ACL**
   - Configured Port Address Translation and Access Control Lists for network security
10. **Static Route & Verification**
    - Added default route and verified connectivity using ping and traceroute
